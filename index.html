      A <b>Blockchain</b> is a type of
      <mark> ledger technology (DLT) </mark>that consists of growing list of
      records, called blocks, that are securely linked together using
      cryptography.<sup>[1][2][3][4]</sup> Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the
      previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented
      as a Merkle tree, where data nodes are represented by leaves). The
      timestamp pr oves that the transaction data existed when the block was
      created. Since each block contains information about the previous block,
      they effectively form a chain (compare linked list data structure), with
      each additional block linking to the ones before it. Consequently,
      blockchain transactions are irreversible in that, once they are recorded,
      the data in any given bloc k cannot be altered retroactively without
      altering all subsequent blocks. <br />

   

      <br />

      Blockchains are typically managed by a peer-to-peer (P2P) computer network
      for use as a public distributed ledger, where nodes collectively adhere to
      a consensus algorithm protocol to add and validate new transaction blocks.
      Although blockchain records are not unalterable, since blockchain forks
      are possible, blockchains may be considered secure by design and exemplify
      a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance.[5]

<h2>History</h2>
    <hr>
    <br><br>
    <p>
      The idea of a distributed timestamp server was first described in 1991 by
      Stuart Haber and Scott Stornetta in a paper titled "How to Time-Stamp a
      Digital Document".[6] Their system, called "The Chain of Trust", was
      based on a chain of signed hash pointers, forming a chain of trust. The
      first blockchain was conceptualized by a person or group known as Satoshi
      Nakamoto in 2008, who published a paper in 2009 titled "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer
      Electronic Cash System".[7] The paper described a system in which
      transactions were grouped into blocks, which were then chained together
      using cryptography. The first blockchain was created in 2009 by Satoshi
      Nakamoto as the backbone of the cryptocurrency bitcoin, whose creator
      Nakamoto integrated many existing ideas from the cypherpunk community. The
      invention of the blockchain for bitcoin made it the first digital currency
      to solve the double-spending problem without the need of a trusted
      authority or central server. The bitcoin design has inspired other
      applications.[8]
